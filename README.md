# Welcome to my recipes Fullstack app

This is still a work in progress, since i'm learning Rust/Yew/Warp/Diesel as I code.

# Running

In the future I'll implement a Docker setup for easier deployment, for now, run

1. Frontend:
   - `trunk serve`
1. Backend:
   - `cargo run`
   - Note: backend is expecting a DATABASE_URL env. var with a valid postgresql link
